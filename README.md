This repository contains some write ups and programmatic tests of protocols that involve sequences of transactions. 

The programmatic tests use a module I wrote called `tx-tools`. If you want to run the tests, clone the repo, `npm install` it, and run the test scripts (eg `sas-cases.js`) with node.js.
